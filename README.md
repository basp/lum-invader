## Lum Invader
This is Oni, the next version. Instead of trying to get as much moving parts in as soon as possible, focus is on design, API, tests and documentation. Little Nugget, (first Oni) is the guide moving forward but the start is fresh.

There is not much here just yet but there is a much better TCP listener mostly due to (Ferd T-H)[https://twitter.com/mononcqc]'s excellent book _Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!_ which cannot be recommended enough. Buy it in dead tree form so you can physically hug it or (just read it for free)[http://learnyousomeerlang.com/] online.

Also now, for the first time in Oni history we have proper unit tests that actually make sure the API functions like expected. This is mainly to cut down on development time because starting everything up to check every single little change was starting to become tedious and time consuming.
