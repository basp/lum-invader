## Lum Invader
This is Oni, the next version. Focus is on design, API, tests and documentation.

#### Installing
Oni (lum invader) is a standard OTP application, you can unzip, compile everything from `src` to `ebin` with 'erlc -o ebin ./src/*.erl` and that's basically it.

#### Bootstrapping
Start Erlang with `erl -pa ebin` and it should return with the standard Erlang shell prompt. First, we need to start to application:

    1> oni:start().
    ok
    2>

You can make sure everything is running with `appmon:start()` but if you get `ok` you're safe to assume that everything went as expected.
